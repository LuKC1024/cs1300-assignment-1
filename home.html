          The upper part of the panel (gray) controls the refrigerator temperature.
          The lower part of the panel, comprised of 6 buttons, controls the ice and

    <p>Is the ice and water dispenser on the refrigerator in my apartment usable
      for every resident? To find out, I asked <a href="#user-response">3 people</a>
      who I observed using the dispenser<sup>[1]</sup>
    <ol>
      <li>What functionalities did you expect when you see this interface
        the first time?</li>
      <li>Did you expect the dispenser to provide ice in two shapes?</li>
      <li>Did you find something unexpected when you use this machine?</li>
      <li>Does the dispenser work as you expected?</li>
      <li>Have you ever been surprised by the dispenser?</li>
      <li>Have you ever found something difficult?</li>
    </ol>

    <section>
      <p class="user-response">
        User 1 expects the dispenser to have the functionality of producing water
        and cubed ice. But he doesn't expect the ice functionality to be usable
        because "I know many refrigerators have a dispenser but most of them don’t work."
        He is surprised that the dispenser also produced crushed ice.
        The dispenser works well for him most of the time, except that
        it is too long ("about 2 seconds") to get crushed ice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When getting ice cubes, this user holds his cup very tight and push hard
        inward to avoid the cup being shaken by fallen ice.
        When the ice cube splashed on his hand, his hand shook slightly.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p class="user-response">
        User 2 expects the dispenser to produce water and maybe ice (in both shapes).
        "I said maybe ice because most of the time I see this machine, the ice function
        doesn’t work", said the user. She is a frequent user of this dispenser and
        complains that the light of the water filter was red when she used the dispenser
        for the first time and that the dispenser initially produces cubed ice even
        when the “crushed” button is pressed. She also thinks the light button behaves
        weiredly. The dispenser turns its light on automatically when someone puts a cup
        under the water/ice outlet even when the light of the "light" button is off.
        This user also thinks it takes too long ("a few seconds") to produces crushed ice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This user consistently placed the cup particularly close to the water/ice outlet
        to avoid splashing. She did avoid all splashing!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p class="user-response">
        User 3 expects the dispenser to produce water and ice in both shapes and to allow
        setting the temperature of water and ice. He thinks the dispenser is very intuitive
        and works as he expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        This user is very calm. He held the cup steadily even when his hands were
        scattered with splashed ice. He thinks the interface works completely as he expected,
        and that the interface is very intuitive.

    <p>Based on these user responses and my observation, I created two personas represented
      by empathy maps: Busy Michael and Neat Jennifer</p>

        <p> Busy Michael is a grad student. He just finished an all-day-long lab section
          and wants to have a cup of iced coke as quickly as possible.</p>
